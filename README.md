# Pokemon-scripts

This was a way to see if I could automate some process while playing pokemon using the c language: I am using Linux and terminal as well as Xdotool
Im sure there are better ways to solve the problems , but as I am a beginner this is the best I came up with 

Fundamentally if i can get to the daycare and spam A, I can win almost every battle with some human aid, i.e choosing the right moves and swapping out pokemon anyways the principle works.
